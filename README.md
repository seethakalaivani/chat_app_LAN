# ðŸ’¬ Local Chat App using Python

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple local chat application I built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **socket programming** as part of my internship project.

The idea was to create a real-time chat system where multiple users can talk to each other on the same local network. It was a fun learning experience working with sockets, threads, and GUI in Python!

What This App Can Do

- Let multiple users join a chat from the same network
- Real-time message sharing
- Simple and clean chat interface using Tkinter
- Messages show with the user name and time
- Detects when a user joins or leaves the chat
- Saves all chat messages into a log file

Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter for the GUI
- Socket & Threading for networking

How to Run the App

1. Start the Server

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder and run:

python server.py

2. Run the client

Open a new terminal in the project folder and run:

python client.py

Run to create multiple client
